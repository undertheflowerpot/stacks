/**
 *  Reconciler algorithm.
 *
 *  See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balking_pattern
 *
 *  The resources collected under a types.Stack are NEITHER intended NOR
 *  capable to be exclusively locked by the reconciler for its operation.
 *
 *  However, if those resources were exclusively lockable, the reconciler
 *  would still have to implement a complicated query under a read-lock
 *  before attempting a write-lock.
 *
 *  The reconciler algorithm instead uses the so-called "Balking Pattern"
 *  to emulate the read-lock / write-lock discipline in order to make changes
 *  to resources (service, config, network, secret, stack).  If nothing has
 *  caused a "Balk" to occur, the decision to make external changes is
 *  justified.
 *
 *  The query implementing the Balk collects information:
 *  1. Which resources require external changes
 *  2. Evidence that another MUTATOR (reconciler, an independent
 *     resource alteration) has been active during the query
 *
 *  Therefore the query is responsible for
 *  1. Limiting the number of proposed external changes/interactions (which
 *     is consistent with the intentions of a read/write lock pattern).
 *  2. Requesting a query retry because a MUTATOR has altered the consistency
 *     of the query (which is what a read-lock would prevent).
 *
 *  Using the query, the Balk itself is implemented thusly:
 *  A. The GOAL state of the reconciler's actions are durably stored
 *     simultaneously with types.Stack BEFORE reconciliation actions occur
 *  B. If the computed GOAL state conflicts with the previous GOAL state,
 *     then the changes to the underlying resources are implied
 *  C. If the previous GOAL state has changed during computing a new GOAL
 *     state, then i) another reconciliation algorithm is active, the
 *     ii) the computed GOAL state is stale
 *
 *  GOAL State:  The Name, ID and swarm.Meta of the resources specified in
 *               types.Stack.  The ID may not be available for individual
 *               resources in certain GOAL States.  swarm.Meta is for
 *               bookkeeping
 *
 *  Implementation Note:  At the time of writing, the GOAL state is not
 *  relying on swarm.Meta to compare the specification versions in order to
 *  detect changes. That would require a greater contract on the UPDATE API
 *  calls to return the the new version and/or object.  Tools like
 *  reflect.DeepEquals to are needed to compare specifications stored in the
 *  stack and in the resource
